# Challenge Summary

**This challenge is Merge Sort**

## Challenge Description

**this challenge is function that accepet an array as argument and sorted it from heigher values to the lowest.**

## Approach & Efficiency
_this problem can be solved by create function that accepet an array as argument, use a nested loop and then make a if condition for determine the max value._

## Big O
   #### mergeSort()
   time O (nlog(n))
   space O (n)
time is a big O(nlog(n)), because there is a nested loop to check for each element in the array.
