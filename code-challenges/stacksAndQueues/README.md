## Challenge Summary
**using class notation, to create the stack and queue of nodes, for the stack, the push(), pop() and peek() methods are created and for the queue, the enqueue(), dequeue() and peek methods are used.**

## Challenge Description
**using class notation, for stacks and queues, for stack, create a push() method that push a new node to the stack and place it at the top, pop() removes the last added stack and assign the second top one as the top one, and a peek() that returns the top stack. and for the queue, create a enqueue() that adds a new queue to the rear, a dequeue() that removes a queue form the front, and peek() that returns the frond node.**

## Approach & Efficiency
***using class notation, and creating an extended classes for the queue and class, no methods are used because the created methods are very straight forward assigning and adding value to the end or begging, removing them, checking if they are empty and peeking the top and rear.***

### Big O
#### stacks
**push(): time O (1) space O (1) because no iterations are required and the method is straight constant the does the job in a constant time and takes the same space. pop(): time O (1) space O (1) because no iterations are required and the method is straight constant the does the job in a constant time and takes the same space. push(): time O (1) space O (1) because no iterations are required and the method is straight constant the does the job in a constant time and takes the same space.**

#### queues
- enqueue():
  - time O (1)
  - space O (1)
 **because no iterations are required and the method is straight constant the does the job in a constant time and takes the same space.**
- dequeue():
  - time O (1)
  - space O (1)
  **because no iterations are required and the method is straight constant the does the job in a constant time and takes the same space.**
- peek():
  - time O (1)
  - space O (1)
  **because no iterations are required and the method is straight constant the does the job in a constant time and takes the same space.**
