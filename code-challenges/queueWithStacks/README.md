# Challenge Summary

**this challenge is built on the previous Code challenge, using the enqueue and the dequeue methods, and the other created methods.**

## Challenge Description

**this challenge is for implementing queue with two stacks, using the previous methods created, enqueue and dequeue.**

## Approach & Efficiency
### What are linked lists?
- Linear chain of Nodes
- Usually just contains a property caled head
 - Head is a Node
our approuch is very straight forward method of breaking the problem into a smaller blocks, 
## Approach & Efficiency
_this code challenge is based on the last code challenge, using the methods to create a queue with stacks, so the pre defined methods are used._

### Big O
   #### enqueue()
   time O (n)
   space O (1)
time is a big O(n), because there is a while loop in push method that will loop through the linked list, but this while loop swap b.
  #### dequeue()
   time O (n)
   space O (n)
because of iterating through the stacks and queues.
